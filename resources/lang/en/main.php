New materials and technologies regularly, tirelessly transform our world for the better, allowing us to realize opportunities that we previously only had to dream about. We offer window grates - transparent polycarbonate. These gratings are durable, aesthetic, lightweight analogs of iron structures, not inferior to them in reliability and durability.',
        'h3_2' => 'Why do we use polycarbonate for window grilles',
        'p_2' => 'Polycarbonate is a modern polymer material, which, despite its relatively light weight, has high strength characteristics. Polycarbonate is now used not only in industrial and residential construction, but even in space technologies. Everyone appreciates polycarbonate for its high resistance to external physical influences, its ability to withstand dynamic loads for a long time without changing its solidity. That is why polycarbonate is ideal for window grilles - transparent, lightweight, and very durable. This material will make window grilles unobtrusive, invisible from the inside and design attractive and lightweight outside the house. For greater aesthetic appeal, such grilles can be covered with a special durable stained glass pattern, which will add bright colors to the interior and exterior of the house.',

At first, their appearance seemed too flimsy to me and I asked my brother why he wasted money on such ineffective protection. In response, he went into the house, opened the window and suggested that I try to break the bars in order to get into the house from the street. Nothing worked for me. After that incident, I installed the same protection in my apartment on the first floor.',

As soon as we began to install polycarbonate grilles, reviews of which I had never seen anywhere else, I decided at my own peril and risk to change the protection on the windows. After installing them, the rooms became brighter, and the metal rods no longer put pressure on my psyche. Everything is in order with safety, too - the reliability of the gratings was checked by my incredulous and strong friends',

Practice has shown that people do not hesitate to install inconspicuous structures, although earlier they flatly refused to install metal gratings. Thanks to this, we help ensure the safety of that part of our clients who are not satisfied with the traditional methods of protecting windows from burglary.',
